Annette SimmonsChris Bangle<p>Designers think everything done by someone else is awful, and that they could do it better themselves, which explains why I designed my own living room carpet, I suppose.  </p>
Kari Piippo<p>When Einstein realized, &#8220;Dear me, this universe with its wonders all adds up to E=mc<sup>2</sup>?,&#8221; he did not stop to think whether this concept would sell better set in Futura or Antikva.  </p>
Des Traynor<p>If you see a few lines of atrocious code, you can make a judgement about the programmer. By judging the programmer, you can judge his boss, and by judging his boss you can judge the company. That&#8217;s the nature of fractals.  </p>
Rob Morris<p>If it were easy to nut out tricky design problems, I might be out of a job. But it’s also true that the cleverness in most lateral design doesn’t come from blindly grinding away at the same concept. When you’re dealing with ideas, it’s rarely a matter of simply putting in more time working. Five minutes can be much more fruitful than five hours.</p>
Saul Bass<p>Design is thinking made visual.  </p>
Charles Willson<p>The definition of an expert is someone who knows what not to do.  </p>
David Starr<p>Wisdom is knowing what to do next, skill is knowing how to do it, and virtue is doing it.  </p>
Steve Krug<p>Don’t let your design resist your readers. Don’t let it stand in the way of what they want to do: read.</p>
Fabien Barral<p>Designers are meant to be loved, not to be understood.  </p>
<p>A good portfolio will get you an interview. A good attitude will get you a job.</p>
Marty AmslerLukas Mathis<p>Redesigning somebody else’s product is always a tricky business. You don’t know why they made the decisions they made. You don’t have the data they have.</p>
Anthony Burgess<p>Translation is not a matter of words only: it is a matter of making intelligible a whole culture.  </p>
<p>An old surrealist trick was to take images that had no business being together and plopping them into the same image. Your mind wants to make associations. Design does that all the time.  </p>
Art ChantryElon Musk<p>Any product that needs a manual to work is broken.</p>
Leonardo da Vinci<p>Learning never exhausts the mind.  </p>
David Karp<p>For every new feature we add, we take an old one out. A lot of big sites don’t do that, and it’s a problem. Twitter started as a beautifully simple product, but it’s now going the same route as Facebook. The drive to innovate can overencumber and destroy a product.</p>
David A. Stuebe<p>Don&#8217;t try and reinvent the wheel &#8211; just work on making it better than anyone else.  </p>
Milton Glaser<p>I go to work every morning with the possibility that I might learn something I don’t already know&#8230; You should look at every problem and think, ‘what can I learn by doing this?’ And if you think you can learn nothing, forget about doing it.</p>
Natalya Shelburne<p>Don&#8217;t you miss doing creative stuff, as an engineer? Don&#8217;t you miss the creativity of the art world? You can say: I&#8217;m working on an infinite canvas capable of any size and shape, that&#8217;s already glowing every color possible into the eyes of just about everyone on the planet. And I get to decide the kind of experience, feeling, and emotion they are going to have. How is that not creative?</p>

Gustave Flaubert<p>Be regular and orderly in your life like a bourgeois, so that you may be violent and original in your work.</p>
Eliot Noyes<p>Good Design:</p>
<p>1. Fulfills its function.<br />
2. Respects its materials.<br />
3. Is suited to method of production.<br />
4. Combines these in imaginative expression.</p>
Adam Judge<p>Users will tell you what they think they want.<br />
Users will tell you what they think you want to hear.<br />
Users will tell you what they think sounds good.<br />
Users will not tell you what you need to know.<br />
You have to watch them to discover that.</p>
Freeman Thomas<p>Good design begins with honesty, asks tough questions, comes from collaboration and from trusting your intuition.  </p>
Matthew Haeck<p>Sometimes the best way to prove your own value is to let a client play the field.</p>
Steven Snell<p>Whenever I have an idea I write it down, even if it&#8217;s not a very good idea. Sometimes the bad ideas will lead to better ones.  </p>
M.C. Escher<p>We adore chaos because we love to produce order.</p>
Emigre<p>Design is a good idea.  </p>
Gidsy.com<p>Descriptions are like skirts, they should be long enough to cover the subject, but short enough to keep things interesting.</p>
Rob Curedale<p>Design is creativity with strategy.  </p>
Mark Zuckerburg<p>There&#8217;s a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.</p>

Thomas Edison<p>Opportunity is missed by people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.  </p>
Bruce Lee<p>&#8230; try to absorb what is useful, discard what is useless, and add what is essentially your own.</p>
Alan Cooper<p>No matter how cool your interface is, it would be better if there were less of it.</p>
Marty Neumeier<p>The best design tool is a long eraser with a pencil at one end.  </p>
Robert L. Peters<p>Design is the application of intent &#8211; the opposite of happenstance, and an antidote to accident.  </p>
